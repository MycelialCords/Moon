## Delay Tips and Tricks 001
### Parameter Automation

**There** are times when sounds that used to excite you are dull, they lost their spark and now you're on the way to becoming a black dwarf. There's no way to fix every problem with the same remedy, hence I just hope that this simple idea will kindle enthusiasm.

**Automation** is an invaluable tool with so many applications that a good chunk of British Library could be filled with different examples and uses. Today I'd like to echo back to 60s and see what a humble delay has to offer. Reason 7 is my go to DAW but today I'll focus on universal parameters such as *'Dry/Wet'*, *'Feedback'*, *'Delay Time'* and *'Modulation'*.

**First** of all, let's start with something simple â€“ sine wave beeping at 440Hz every bar.

**After** inserting delay and making my computer move knobs with its invisible hand this is what I got.

**For** variety, I also did a second take modulating same parameters.

**Nice** and simple, but what will happen with more complex examples? Let's have a look at drums, pad, and bass with the same automation and see what happens.

/Durms/ 
/Pad/
/Bass/

**In** my humble opinion, it didn't work for the low end so let me move some boxes around.

/Bass/

**Much better.**

**Automation** by itself isn't necessary anything spectacular but at the same time, possibilities are pretty much endless. So I hope that sharing these examples inspired somebody to use a delay in a new way. I'm eager to hear your creations. 

**Also**, feel free to download all the patches, the Reason file and audio loops here. Let me know what you think.
