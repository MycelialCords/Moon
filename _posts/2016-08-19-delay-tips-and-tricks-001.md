**There** are times when sounds that used to excite you are dull, they lost their spark and now you're on the way to become the next black dwarf. There's no way to fix every problem with the same remedy, hence I just hope that this simple idea will spark.

**Automation** is an invaluable tool with so many applications that a good chunk of British Library could be filled with different examples and uses. Today I'd like to echo back to 60s and see what a humble delay has to offer. Reason 7 is my go to DAW but today I'll focus on universal parameters such as *'Dry/Wet'*, *'Feedback'*, *'Delay Time'* and *'Modulation'*.

___

**First** of all, let's start with something simple â€“ sine wave beeping at 440Hz every bar.
<audio controls preload="none"
oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()">

</audio>

**After** inserting delay and making my computer move knobs with its invisible hand this is what I got. 
<audio controls preload="none"
oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()">		
<source src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0BxDTpmbDjqHoT00zamxONHp1YVE" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

And with precise numbers

**For** variety, I also did a second take modulating same parameters.
<audio controls preload="none"
oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()">

</audio>

**Nice** and simple, but what will happen with more complex examples? Let's have a look at drums, pad, and bass with the same automation and see what happens.

**Note: I've ommited dry examples and seconde delay automation to aviod cluttering the post. Head to my [drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxDTpmbDjqHobW82WV9lMGhzelE) to see the rest.

**Pad Delay 1**

oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()">

**Bass Delay 1**

oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()">

**Automation** by itself isn't anything new but at the same time, possibilities are pretty much endless. So I hope that sharing these examples inspired somebody to use a delay (or any other effect) in a new way. I'm eager to hear your creations. 

**Also**, feel free to [download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxDTpmbDjqHobW82WV9lMGhzelE) all the patches, the Reason file and audio loops and use them in your productions.
