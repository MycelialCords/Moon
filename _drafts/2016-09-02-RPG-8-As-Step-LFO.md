**With** the power of CV one can come up with ideas and solutions without an end. To exploit it further, I made a promise to myself that each week I'll deliberatry think of a new way to route devices. RPG-8 has been on my list for some time and I coulnd't be happier after setting it up as a complex step-LFO. Here's how I've done that.

**Basic** setup - Combinator and RPG-8. Then it's up to you. I've always wanted to be able to smooth step and pulse LFOs to avoid clicks, then I found out about using The Pulsviser's Follower to achieve that, so I'm going to add it here. Since Thor is my go-to synth it's also a member of the team. The reason for combinator is to have a better control over values and to see what's going on. 

**In** this case, gate is the important output but note can also find it's application, hence it's also connected in the attached patches. However, I'm only making a use of gate. Value of CV output is controlled through note velocity. What happens next is decided through combinator. The amazing thing is that few RPG-8s can influence one another and unpredictable things happen - I'm not even talking about the mesmerizing movement of all the knobs and values...

**Anyway**, let's get to actual examples. I'm going to start with filtered sawtooth that plays one note to show the power of this technique. Then I'm going to provide more musical examples as well as share with you a small reFill with premade routings and few loops.

**I'll** be more than happy to hear what you think of it and what you made with it.
