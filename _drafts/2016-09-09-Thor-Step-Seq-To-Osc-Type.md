I had a short episode with audio programming languages few months ago. My favorite one was SuperCollider and it opened my mind when it comes to algorithmic music creation. However, lack of GUI put me off and now I sometimes just sythesize some sounds to later use in Reason. The good thing is that SuperCollider made me want to apply some techniques to Reason's routing and this is how this idea started. 

Thor has built-in step sequencer and with some tweaking you can use it to modulate anything with its CV output. Also, automating number of steps can make it easy to create really complex polyrythimc sequences - something that I love. With using more than one Thor you can go even further and have a bunch of oscillators dance while changing their type and enhancing your basses and leads.

First of all, you need to disable 'step seq' in the trigger section of thor. Set the sequencer to step, make MIDI gate trigger it and route output of 'Curve 1' to CV 1 Out. Connect it to combinator's CV and then use the modulation to control OSC Type in Thor. In the Reason patch I've made one sequencer change type of two oscillators by changing numbers in combinator and Curve value. Also, remember that you need to have space between the notes to make MIDI gate work. As I am also giving you the patch you can see it in action.

To show the techique I prepared a short psytrance-like loop. I'm sharing with you the loops, default patch and the reason project. As always, you're free to use this stuff anywhere, directing to my page would be appreciated.

**Psytrance Lead**

**Percussion**

**Bass**

There's loads of stuff you ca achieve doing that so I'm eager to hear your ideas.
