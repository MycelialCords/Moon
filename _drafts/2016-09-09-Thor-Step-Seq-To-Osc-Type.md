I had a short episode with audio programming languages few months ago. My favorite one was SuperCollider and it opened my mind when it comes to algorithmic music creation. However, lack of GUI put me off and now I sometimes just sythesize some sounds to later use in Reason. The good thing is that SuperCollider made me want to apply some techniques to Reason's routing and this is how this idea started. 

Thor has built-in step sequencer and with some tweaking you can use it to modulate anything with its CV output. Also, automating number of steps can make it easy to create really complex polyrythimc sequences - something that I love. With using more than one Thor you can go even further and have a bunch of oscillators dance while chaning their type and enhancing your basses and leads.

I'm sharing with you a couple of sound examples, patches and the reason project. As always, you're free to use this stuff anywhere, directing to my page would be appreciated.
